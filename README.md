# Introduction 
A little TypeScript project shows how to find a missing number inside a sorted array.  
This project contains two examples (located in one class).   
The first example shows how to find the missing number in the sorted array using a JavaScript predefined method (filter method).  
The second example shows how to find the missing number in the sorted array using a custom method (written by me).  
We are measuring the execution time to show the difference between the two examples. My solution is faster than the JavaScript solution.  

# Getting Started
Please follow the steps to set up the project:   

### Installation process
1. Clone the repository.  
2. If you don't have Node.js - download and install it: https://nodejs.org/en/ . The LTS version should be OK.  
3. Open the project from your IDE. The IDE should have installed TypeScript. I prefer to use Visual Studio Code - which comes with installed TypeScript. If your IDE doesn't have installed TypeScript, you can install it globally by executing the following npm command in the terminal.  
> npm install -g typescript  
4. Navigate to the project root folder from the terminal.  
5. Get all dependencies:  
> npm install  
6. To execute the class that contains two examples - run the following  in the terminal:  
> npm run start  

Make sure you execute the command at the root of the project folder.  
8. Read the readme.md file and comments inside the {root}/src/findMissingNumber.ts class for more details.   

### Colorize the log:
Because reading log data from the terminal is not easy, I colorize the messages for easy reading.
